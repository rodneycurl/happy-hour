# ZOOLANDER

# About Zoolander
Zoolander is a class project in which my teammate and I will be building a ticketing app, that will discount and display the final price for admission into the Zoo depending on the day and age of the person attending (Note: all children below the age of 6 are granted free admission). Ultimately, we will be displaying a total for the user to know their total payment needed for their ticket.

# Why Zoolander
Zoolander was built because we wanted to produce an application that would allow zoo goers an easy and efficient way to calculate their total discount and have a final receipt upon buying tickets to the Zoo. Our team discussed the problems people face when trying to get into venues that sometimes have discounts for youth vs adults.

Zoolander solves the very complicated problem of having to keep up with coupons and dates by automatically generating your coupons the moment you enter the time and dates you'd like to attend.

# Java History
Java was created by James Gosling and first appeared 21 years ago on May 23, 1995.

Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

Java is currently being maintained by https://www.java.com

# Thoughts on Java
After building an application with Java it seems to follow similar rules that we've found in previous languages that we've used in the pass. For example the if/else statements are pretty similar to if/else statements from JavaScript. So that was cool to see.

# Zoolander Hurdles
One of the biggest hurdles we had with this assignment was trying to keep it below 50 lines of code.
